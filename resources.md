# JupyterHub

JupyterHub will be used extensively in lectures and hands-on sessions. It gives users access to Jupyter Notebooks (computational environments and resources used in this class) without the hassle of installation and maintenance on local computers. The Jupyter Project documentation can be found [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Alternatively, many videos about JupyterHub and Jupyter Notebooks can be found on YouTube. However, the JupyterHub server has a user storage limit of 5 GB and max memory of 4 GB. You must have stable internet connections to use the JupyterHub.

# Running Jupyter Notebooks and Python on Local Computers

To use Jupyeter Notebooks on local computers, we recommend downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
